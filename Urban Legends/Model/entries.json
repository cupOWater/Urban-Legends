        "One of the most famous Cryptids worldwide, Bigfoot, AKA Sasquatch, is a large (1.8m - 2.7m), humanoid creature with ape-like features. One of its distinct characteristics was the large footprints for which it is named. Despite being documented relatively recently, paintings of a creature similar to Bigfoot were found in many indigenous cultures around North America. Some speculate that Bigfoot might even be a surviving specimen of the extinct genus Gigantopithecus blacki.",
